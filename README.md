# Parallel PopGen Package v0.4 README

The Parallel PopGen Package (3P) is a library of CUDA C++ APIs consisting of the GO_Fish simulation API (with an associated optional Sim_Model API) and the Spectrum API to simulate allele trajectories and generate SFS respectively. Programs using the APIs can compiled on Mac OSX, Linux, and Windows operating systems. An offline link to the API manual can be found in documents/API.html (Mac/Linux softlink for convenience) and docs/index.html (Mac/Linux/Windows). Online access for the manual of the old release is at: [http://dl42.github.io/ParallelPopGen/](http://dl42.github.io/ParallelPopGen/). The documentation/ folder also contains a copy of the paper: "Accelerating Wright-Fisher Forward Simulations on the Graphics Processing Unit", which should be cited if the Parallel PopGen Package is used (currently on [bioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/11/042622)).

Parallel PopGen Package requires an NVIDIA GPU with a minimum of compute capability 3.0. [List of NVIDIA GPUs.](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)  

To use the API package, [install CUDA Toolkit 7.2. or greater.](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) For those with [CUDA Toolkit 6.5.](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-65) and Maxwell 2 GPUs (e.g. GeForce GTX9xx GPUs) first install the previous toolkit to get the drivers, then download the previous version of ParallelPopgen.  The new API is built on the foundation of the old API, so the documentation is similar.  Current documentation can be seen in the new functions available.
